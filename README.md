# Hello & Welcome to my GitHub! 
## Feel free to poke around 🐙.

Errol here! I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science and Mathematics from Whitman College.
I'm interested in Machine Learning and actively learning to code in Julia at the moment. 
I'm also quite interested in creating visualizaions for some of my favorite math subjects. 
Currently, I am working on polishing up some dusty 🧹 personal projects so that the world can see them!

If its looking a bit bare around here it's because the largest of my coding endevours have been for other organizations and/or the government 😅.
